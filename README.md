# Monofurx : the monospace font

## A modification to the monospace font MONOFUR



- Q: How to use or download?

- A: Copy *.otf to the system fonts folder or use fonts management tools to install.



This is a modification version of the monofur font, tooled with Font Forge.

The original monofur font is a monospaced version of font EuroFurence

I like this font much, but there're still optimizing spaces:

The manily modifications are the heavier-weighted puncutations dots;

and a little funny part: the **ASYMMETRIC** brackets-pairs just for fun, and feel free to make them normally symmetric if you don't like them.

**this modded-fonts ONLY includes ASCII glyphs, please notice this!**
**if you want other glyphs diplayed, just copy other glyphs out from folder 'src/original_ver_of_monofur_fonts' with the software 'FONTFORGE', or you could use other fonts as fallback.**

**tips: delete the old versioned monofux fonts manually completely from the system font directory, or there might be some errors for some software to select the correct versioned font/s, e.g, pycharm on windows 10**
