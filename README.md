# Monofurx : the monospace font

## A modification to the monospace font MONOFUR



- Q: How to use or download?

- A: Copy *.otf to the system fonts folder or use fonts management tools to install.



This is a modification version of the monofur font, tooled with Font Forge.

The original monofur font is a monospaced version of font EuroFurence

I like this font much, but there're still optimizing spaces:

The mainly modifications are the heavier-weighted puncutations dots;

and a little funny part: the **ASYMMETRIC** brackets-pairs just for fun, and feel free to make them normally symmetric if you don't like them.

**this modded-fonts ONLY includes ASCII glyphs, please notice this!**
**if you want other glyphs diplayed, just copy other glyphs out from folder 'src/original_ver_of_monofur_fonts' with the software 'FONTFORGE', or you could use other fonts as fallback.**

**tips: delete the old versioned monofux fonts manually completely from the system font directory, or there might be some errors for some software to select the correct versioned font/s, e.g, pycharm on windows 10**

## V3.0 Memo:

Dec 02, 2017

1. bigger dots in 'i','j','!','?','.',';',':','·'(middle-dot)
2. comma ',' ,semi-colon ';','_','~','-' : bolded and lengthened
3. more than 45° withershins leaned grave '`'
4. 'i' with a shortened tail
5. '|' lengthened
6. 'G' bolded and lengthened the vertical line part, rigging-angled, in order to distinguish from 'C' in calculated italic shapes
7. **ASYMMETRIC** brackets-pairs, () [] {}
8. more distinguishable quotes with different angles: `'"
9. sunk 'period' '.' and underscore'_'to bottom
10. 'g' a bigger feather top ^_^
11. cleanup all 'K' glyphs both in Latin zone and Cyrillic zone
12. clear the glyphs with BLANK-WITE, which can't be overwritten if they're used
13. add auto hint
14. change some glyphs such as 'bullet'(U+2022) to the right character
15. Add an ITALIC mod as a completion, because the italic letters not just simply leaned a related angle.(this italic mod also has most modifications of the regular styled monofurx)
16. Change the Italic Angle of "monof56.ttf" , from  (15°) to monofurx-italic.ttf's (-15°)
17. Clean up some ambiguous quote marks.
18. Clean up all other glyphs, with ONLY ASCII CHARS LEFT to avoid unforeseen fallback errors!!!
